    <h1><b>Name: Naganohara Yoimiya</b></h1>
    <p><b>Education:</b> Brooklyn College Education Major <i>Graduate 2024</i></p>
    <p><b>Skills:</b> Critical thinking, Patience with children, Good Communication,Organisational and Creative thinking abilities</p>
    <p><b>I am a talented firework craftsman. The current owner of "Naganohara Fireworks Shop", 
        I have a creativity as strong as fireworks, and I can always bring unparalleled surprises to people. 
        I often play some simple and interesting games with the children, or tell stories with them. 
        The innocence of children makes me feel extremely happy. 
        I'm a social person, always jumping at every opportunity to strike up a conversation, 
        with a seemingly endless supply of anecdotes and ideas to share. 
        Principles and ingenuity are what I cherish the mostâ€”although fireworks are fleeting,
        the gorgeous light and shadow can remain in people's hearts forever. For a moment, and for eternity.</b></p>
